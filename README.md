This R package provides data and models for predicting toxicokinetics (chemical 
absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion by the body). 
The models are design to be parameterized with chemical-specific in vitro 
(animal free) measurements. The predictions can be used for traditional
dosimetry as well as in vivo-in vitro extrapolation (IVIVE) of in vitro 
bioactivity testing data (for example, ToxCast). See [Breen et al. 
(2021)](<https://doi.org/10.1080/17425255.2021.1935867>) for a recent review.

This repository is for reporting bugs and contributing enhancements. Installable

## Description

Pre-made models that can be rapidly tailored to various chemicals
and species using chemical-specific in vitro data and physiological 
information. These tools allow incorporation of chemical 
toxicokinetics ("TK") and in vitro-in vivo extrapolation ("IVIVE") 
into bioinformatics, as described by [Pearce et al. (2017)](<https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v079.i04>). Chemical-specific 
in vitro data characterizing toxicokinetics have been obtained 
from relatively high-throughput experiments. The 
chemical-independent ("generic") physiologically-based ("PBTK") and empirical 
(for example, one compartment) "TK" models included here can be 
parameterized with in vitro data or in silico predictions which are 
provided for thousands of chemicals, multiple exposure routes, 
and various species. High throughput toxicokinetics ("HTTK") is the 
combination of in vitro data and generic models. We establish the
expected accuracy of HTTK for chemicals without in vivo data 
through statistical evaluation of HTTK predictions for chemicals
where in vivo data do exist. The models are systems of ordinary 
differential equations that are developed in MCSim and solved
using compiled (C-based) code for speed. A Monte Carlo sampler is
included for simulating human biological variability
([Ring et al., 2017](<https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2017.06.004>))
and propagating parameter uncertainty 
([Wambaugh et al., 2019](<https://doi.org/10.1093/toxsci/kfz205>)). 
Empirically calibrated methods are included for predicting 
tissue:plasma partition coefficients and volume of distribution ([Pearce et al., 
2017](<https://doi.org/10.1007/s10928-017-9548-7>)).
These functions and data provide a set of tools for using IVIVE to
convert concentrations from high-throughput screening experiments
(for example, Tox21, ToxCast) to real-world exposures via reverse 
dosimetry (also known as "RTK")
([Wetmore et al., 2015](<https://doi.org/10.1093/toxsci/kfv171>)).

## Chemical Insights

UL Research Institutes’ Chemical Insights Research Institute (ULRI-CIRI) is an independent, non-profit research organization (501(c)(3)) dedicated to advancing the understanding of chemical exposures and their impacts on human health. Building on UL’s 130-year legacy in safety science, we are committed to producing peer-reviewed, open-access research that serves as a trusted resource for the public and scientific community.
CIRI develops data and tools that adhere to the FAIR principles [Wilkinson et al. 2016](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18): Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. Our mission is to provide trustworthy, scientifically grounded predictions of chemical behavior.

We emphasize rigorous scientific peer review, and best practices in software development and engineering:
1. Wherever possible, we integrate existing, peer-reviewed data and tools.
2. When creating new data or methods, we submit them to external peer review to ensure quality and credibility.
3. We try to make our research open-source where possible, and use continuous integration and testing to ensure high-quality software

Our goal is to inform standards, support evidence-based decision-making, and protect public health. We are passionate about advancing scientific discovery and applying it to real-world health challenges.

## Getting Started

For an introduction to R, see Irizarry (2022) "Introduction to Data Science": 
<http://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu/dsbook/getting-started.html>

For an introduction to toxicokinetics, with examples in "httk", see Ring (2021) in the "TAME Toolkit":

### Dependencies

* Users will need the freely available R statistical computing language: <https://www.r-project.org/>
* Users will likely want a development environment like RStudio: <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>
* If you get the message "Error in library(X) : there is no package called 'X'" then you will need to install that package: 
```
install.packages("X")
```
Or, if using RStudio, look for ‘Install Packages’ under ‘Tools’ tab.
* Note that R does not recognize fancy versions of quotation marks ‘,$~$’,$~$“, or$~$”. 
If you are cutting and pasting from software like Word or Outlook you may need 
to replace the quotation marks that curve toward each other with ones typed by 
the keyboard.

### Installing R package "httk"

Adapted from [Breen et al. (2021)](<https://doi.org/10.1080/17425255.2021.1935867>)

* Getting Started with R Package httk from the R command line
```
install.packages("httk")
```
Load the HTTK data, models, and functions
```
library(httk)
```
* Check what version you are using 
```
packageVersion("httk")
```

### Examples

* List all CAS numbers for all chemicals with sufficient data to run httk 
```
get_cheminfo()
```
* List all information (If median.only=FALSE you will get medians, lower 95th,
 and upper 95th for Fup, plus p-value for Clint, separated by commans, when
 those statistics are available. Older data only have means for Clint and Fup.): 
```
get_cheminfo(info = "all", median.only=TRUE)
```
* Is a chemical with a specified CAS number available? 
```
"80-05-7" %in% get_cheminfo()
```
* All data on chemicals A, B, C (You need to specify the names instead of "A","B","C"...)
```
subset(get_cheminfo(info = "all"), Compound %in% c("A","B","C"))
```
* Administrated equivalent dose (mg/kg BW/day) to produce 0.1 uM plasma concentration, 0.95
quantile, for a specified CAS number and species
```
calc_mc_oral_equiv(0.1,chem.cas = "34256-82-1",species = "human")
calc_mc_oral_equiv(0.1,chem.cas = "99-71-8", species = "human")
```
* Calculate the mean, AUC, and peak concentrations for a simulated study (28-day daily dose, by
default) for a specified CAS number and species
```
calc_tkstats(chem.cas = "34256-82-1",species = "rat")
calc_tkstats(chem.cas = "962-58-3", species = "rat")
```
* Using the PBTK solver for a specified chem name 
```
solve_pbtk(chem.name = "bisphenol a", plots = TRUE)
```
* Create data set, my_data, for all data on chemicals A, B, C, in R 
```
my_data <- subset(get_cheminfo(info = "all"), Compound %in% c("A","B","C"))
```
* Export data set, my_data, from R to csv file called my_data.csv in the current working directory 
```
write.csv(my_data, file = "my_data.csv")
```
#### User Notes

* When using the CAS number as a unique chemical identifier with 'httk'
functions it is best to type these numbers directly (i.e. by hand) into the
console, script, Rmarkdown, etc. to avoid unnecessary error messages. Webpages,
word documents, and other sources of these CAS numbers may use a
different character encoding that does not match those used in the 'httk' data
sources.

## Help

* Getting help with R Package httk 
```
help(httk)
```
